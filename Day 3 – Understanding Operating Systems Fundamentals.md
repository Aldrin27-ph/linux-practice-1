# Day 3 – Operating Systems Fundamentals

## Overview
Today I focused on understanding **how operating systems work** and why they are critical in real-world computing, especially in cloud environments. This session helped me build a strong conceptual foundation before going deeper into hands-on Linux and cloud work.

## What Is an Operating System?
An Operating System (OS) is the software that acts as an intermediary between:
- The **user**
- The **hardware**
- The **applications**

It manages system resources and allows users and applications to interact with the computer efficiently.

## Core Components of an Operating System

### 1. Kernel
- The kernel is the **core of the operating system**
- It manages:
  - CPU scheduling
  - Memory management
  - Process management
  - Hardware communication
- Users do not interact with the kernel directly

### 2. User Space
- Where applications and user commands run
- Communicates with the kernel through system calls

## Types of Operating Systems
- **GUI-based OS**  
  Example: Windows, macOS  
  Uses graphical elements like windows, buttons, and icons

- **CLI-based OS**  
  Example: Linux (terminal-based)  
  Uses text commands and is commonly used in servers and cloud systems

## Why Linux Is Important for Cloud
- Most cloud servers run **Linux**
- Lightweight and efficient
- Highly configurable
- Open-source and widely supported

Understanding Linux is essential for cloud engineering and cloud support roles.

## Linux Commands Practiced
I practiced basic Linux navigation and file management commands:

- `pwd` – show current directory  
- `ls`, `ls -l` – list files and directories  
- `cd`, `cd /`, `cd ~`, `cd ../..` – navigate directories  
- `mkdir`, `mkdir -p` – create directories  
- `touch` – create files  
- `echo` – output text  
- `cat` – view file content  
- `rm`, `rmdir`, `rm -r` – remove files and directories  
- `clear` – clear terminal  
- `history` – view command history  

These commands form the foundation of daily Linux usage.

## Key Takeaways
- Operating systems manage how users, applications, and hardware interact
- Linux is the dominant OS in cloud environments
- Understanding OS concepts makes troubleshooting and cloud work easier

This knowledge sets the groundwork for deeper Linux practice and future cloud deployment tasks.
